Lieutenant Les wears a crisp, bespoke military-style corporate suit of the period. His face is the focal point of the portrait; it is perfectly clear and healthy, with **no blemishes or signs of illness around his nose or mouth**, emphasizing his distance from \"Muck-Slingers\" (species associated with mucosal involvement).\n\nOn his chest, fixed to his pristine lapel, is a **single, modest copper button**. The button is meticulously detailed to look exactly like a tiny copper cent, its diameter visibly **smaller than one centimeter**, representing the limited size and number of his lesions. The environment is impeccably clean, free of any grime or \"muck,\" highlighting the localized and non-mucosal nature of his condition. The image has the texture of an early 20th-century silver gelatin print, with slight vignetting and a rich, monochromatic sepia tone that underscores the 1917 theme.",

He is holding a heavy, specialized trench axe labeled **'Akt'** on the steel blade, which he is using to strike a microscopic-style diagram of a cellular membrane. \n\n**The Map:** Spread across the table is a detailed tactical map clearly labeled **'BRAZIL-GUY-PANAMA.'** He is pointing a brass compass at these specific regions.\n\n**The Soldiers (Background):** To the left, a group of teenage soldiers (clearly older than 12) in puttees and Brodie helmets are visible. They are clutching their stomachs in discomfort, and behind them hangs a medical clipboard with a prominent **'Yellow Liver'** chart showing rising bar graphs. \n\n**The Shield:** Mounted prominently on the bunker wall is a circular steel shield with a large **'5'** embossed in the center, featuring a crossed-out silhouette of a pregnant recruit to signify a strict 5-month prohibition.\n\n**The Lieutenants:** In the background shadows, two junior officers, **'Fluke-Nazole'** and **'Key-Nazole,'** are frantically reviewing smaller maps titled **'MAJOR'** and **'MEXICAN.'** They look overwhelmed, looking out through a bunker slit toward a dark, misty No-Man's-Land where the word **'VIANNIA'** is spray-painted on a ruined tank.\n\n**Style & Composition:** \n*   **Theme:** 1917 period-accurate aesthetics (WWI).\n*   **Color Palette:** Desaturated earth tones, olive drabs, muddy browns, and high-contrast shadows, with the 'Yellow Liver' chart providing a sickly pop of color.\n*   **Lighting:** Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting from a single hanging lamp, creating a tense, historical atmosphere.\n*   **Technical:** 35mm film grain, hyper-realistic textures of wool and rusted metal, cinematic wide shot.",

Beside him, his nervous assistant, **‘De-Ox’**, has just knocked over a bottle of glowing, corrosive black ink. The ink is spreading across a uniquely woven **kidney-shaped rug** on the floor. Nearby, an iron radiator is leaking steam, and a visible brass **letter 'K'** is falling off its side and melting into a puddle.\n\nThrough a heavy open doorway leading to an adjacent map room, **‘Lip-Service’ Sam** is visible. He wears a radio operator's headset and holds a bizarre, biological-looking **‘Macro-Phone’** (a megaphone shaped like a textured macrophage cell). He is intensely studying a large leather-bound ledger with the numbers **'15 to 30'** embossed in gold on the cover.\n\nIn the foreground, a disheveled messenger named **‘Pent-Up’ Dean**, wearing a mud-stained tropical uniform with a **'GUYANA'** shoulder patch, has just collapsed to one knee. He is clutching his upper abdomen (the **pancreas** area) in visible agony. He has dropped a bundle of **7 letters** tied with twine; the top envelope is clearly postmarked with **'3 Weeks'**. His face is deathly pale, suggesting low blood pressure, while a medic in the corner prepares a **sugar-syrup injection** to revive him from a sudden diabetic faint.\n\nThe image should be hyper-realistic with high-contrast shadows, focusing on the textures of wool uniforms, weathered paper, and the polished wood of the 1917 era.

The room is filled with a hazy, amber-hued atmosphere of cigar smoke and flickering oil lamps. The composition is centered on a massive, scarred wooden oak table where the \"Flattening Officer\" and the \"Young Lieutenant\" are strategizing.\n\n**Key Visual Elements and Characters:**\n*   **The Flattening Officer (First Sign of Healing):** A grizzled, senior military commander in a weathered 1917 British officer’s tunic. He is physically pressing his palms down on a raised, textured topographical map of a battlefield, flattening the ridges to represent the **First Sign of Healing (Flattening of the skin lesion).**\n*   **The Three-Week Flare Up (Paradoxical Response):** In the background, visible through a reinforced window, a chaotic explosion of red sparks and thick smoke billows from a trench. This represents the **Paradoxical Response**, where the situation looks more inflamed and violent during the first 21 days despite treatment.\n*   **The Half-Sized Strategic Map (50% Size Reduction):** On the table next to the officer sits a smaller, secondary parchment map exactly half the size of the original. A bold stamp on it reads **\"WEEK 6\"**, signifying the **50% size reduction** marker.\n*   **The 3-Month Gold Seal (Complete Reepithelialization):** The Young Lieutenant holds a heavy brass embosser, ready to press a shimmering gold wax seal onto a document labeled **\"MONTH 3.\"** The seal is perfectly smooth and unbroken, symbolizing **Complete Reepithelialization (Full skin closure).**\n*   **The Quarterly Airway Sentry (Mucosal Surveillance):** To the right, a Sentry wearing a gas mask and holding a polished brass periscope looks intently into the dark, arched opening of a ventilation tunnel (representing the **Airways/Nasopharyngeal path**). A calendar on the wall beside him has marks every **3 months (Quarterly)**.\n*   **The Two-Year Long-Term Scout (ML Follow-up):** In the far distance, visible through a tunnel exit, a lone scout with binoculars stands on a ridge under a fading sunset, symbolizing the **2-year long-term monitoring** required for Mucosal Leishmaniasis.\n\n**Style and Aesthetic (1917 Theme):**\n*   **Color Palette:** Desaturated earth tones—olive drab, sepia, charcoal, and burnt sienna—punctuated by the warm glow of lanterns and the metallic gold of the 3-month seal.\n*   **Texture:** Gritty and hyper-detailed. Visible wood grain on the table, wool texture on the uniforms, mud on the boots, and the tactile quality of old parchment paper.\n*   **Lighting:** Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting (high contrast) reminiscent of 1917 trench cinema. Deep shadows in the corners of the room with sharp light hitting the map and the characters' faces to emphasize the gravity of the \"medical\" mission.\n*   **Technical Specs:** 8k resolution, cinematic lighting, photorealistic, historical drama style, wide-angle lens.",
