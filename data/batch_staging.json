Professor Astra (Chronic Asthma) is teaching her class how to keep the 'Symptom Soup' from boiling over (Symptom Control) while keeping 'Lung Balloons' safely in 'Preserve Jars' (Preserve Lung Function). She uses a giant shield to stop the 'Exasperated Fire-Breathing Dragon' (Exacerbation Risk) and warns everyone to avoid the 'Side-Saddle Slide' (Side Effects). In her classroom, students are busy playing soccer and sleeping soundly (Normal Activities). To graduate, they must meet the Four Pillars: Ed the Bookworm (Education), a 'No-Trigger' Sign over a dusty cat (Minimizing Triggers), Moni the Monitor Lizard with a peak-flow meter (Monitoring), and Farmer-Pill who grows medicine crops (Pharmacology). Everything they do is checked against the 'Gina Giraffe’s Rulebook' (GINA Guidelines)!",

        "visual_prompt": "thought)**Visual Prompt: The Grand Lecture of Professor Wheeze**\n\n**Theme:** Professional Educator\n**Style:** Cinematic, highly detailed 3D digital illustration with a scholarly yet whimsical atmosphere. The lighting is warm and academic, reminiscent of a prestigious university hall but with surreal medical elements.\n\n**Scene Description:**\nIn a magnificent, cavernous auditorium shaped like the interior of a giant, translucent human lung—complete with glowing bronchiole arches and soft pink walls—**Professor Wheeze**, a distinguished, silver-haired academic in a sharp tweed waistcoat and spectacles, stands center stage. He embodies the **Professional Educator**, maintaining a calm, commanding, and instructional presence amidst a whirlwind of activity.\n\n**Key Visual Elements:**\n*   **The Big Five Juggling Act:** Professor Wheeze is expertly juggling five glowing, holographic shields. Each shield features a distinct icon: a golden **Flute** (Influenza), a jagged **New-Mocker** stone (Pneumococcus), a soft **Purring-Puss** cat (Pertussis), a glowing **Spike-Ball** (SARS-CoV-2), and a metallic **Resvi-Robot** (RSV).\n*   **The Pneumococcal Lesson:** To the side, the Professor has just tossed a second **New-Mocker shield** to a focused student aged 19-64, illustrating the specific booster requirement for this age group.\n*   **The Paxlovid Interaction:** In the foreground, the Professor uses a firm, \"stop\" hand gesture toward a student attempting to eat a box of **'Pax-Lover' chocolates**. The student is holding toys of a **'Salmon-Meter'** (a fish-shaped inhaler) and a **'Villain-Trolley'** (a miniature spiked cart), which are vibrating violently with red energy streaks to indicate a dangerous interaction.\n*   **The Zanamivir Contraindication:** At the auditorium door, a gothic student named **'Zana-Vampire'** attempts to enter. The Professor points a stern finger at a glowing **'No Breathing' sign** (a circle with a slash through a pair of lungs) because her dark, smoky cape is swirling into the room, mimicking bronchospasm.\n*   **The VIP Prednisone Pizza:** Near the front row, a student struggles to hold a massive, heavy box labeled **'20-Pounds'** filled with a **'Prednisone-Pizza.'** The Professor is handing them a glowing **'Immunocompromised VIP Pass'** with a scholarly nod, indicating they follow a different vaccination track.\n*   **The Biologic Puzzle:** On a side lectern, a complex, glowing **'Bio-Logic' logic puzzle** sits. As one of the vaccine shields brushes past it, the puzzle's light slightly dims or fades. The Professor is depicted with a sophisticated, professional shrug, looking at the puzzle with a \"not clinically significant\" expression.\n\n**Technical Details:**\n*   **Color Palette:** Deep mahoganies, soft lung-pinks, and vibrant neon glows from the shields.\n*   **Composition:** Wide-angle shot to capture the scale of the lung auditorium, with the Professor as the focal point.\n*   **Atmosphere:** Educational, authoritative, and meticulously organized, highlighting the Professor’s role as an expert guide through complex medical management.",

Vibrant but balanced colors, sharp focus, and clear architectural lines.\n\n**Setting:** A futuristic, high-tech classroom led by **Professor Ash-Ma**, a poised and professional educator in a sleek, white lab coat. She is gesturing with a digital pointer toward a massive, polished \"Assessment Trio\" kiosk.\n\n**The Kiosk:** A centerpiece machine with three distinct sections labeled in clear, professional typography: \"Symptoms,\" \"Lung Function,\" and \"Exacerbation Risk.\" It features holographic displays showing glowing medical charts and data visualizations.\n\n**The Characters & Elements:**\n*   **The Spyro-Meter:** To the side stands a large, stylized dragon-shaped wind gauge (the Spyro-Meter). Its wings act as a dial, and its scales are polished chrome. A student is professionally performing spirometry into it.\n*   **The Four-Step Staircase:** In the center of the room is a tiered platform representing the levels of asthma severity.\n    *   **The First Step (Mild):** A small, soft-looking kitten (Mild-Mew) sits here. Professor Ash-Ma has placed a bright, red \"NO COMPLACENCY\" warning sticker directly over its nameplate, making the warning the visual focus.\n    *   **The Middle Step (Moderate):** A sturdy, calm moose (Moderate-Moose) stands here. It is expertly balancing two large, rectangular ice cream sandwiches—labeled \"Medium ICS\"—on its antlers like a tray.\n    *   **The Top Step (Severe):** A \"Severe-Sovereign\" king in heavy, ornate gold armor. He is holding massive, oversized \"High-Dose\" ice cream sandwiches. Despite his power, his facial expression is visibly strained and stressed, surrounded by glowing red \"Danger Dice\" symbols.\n*   **The Step-Down Ladder:** Leaning against the high platform is a sleek, silver \"Step-Down\" ladder. Professor Ash-Ma is pointing to the bottom of the ladder, where a small, single \"Minimal Dose\" snack sits, illustrating the goal of finding the lowest effective treatment.\n\n**Atmosphere & Lighting:** Bright, clinical, and encouraging. The lighting is crisp and even, highlighting the textures of the armor, the fur of the animals, and the digital glow of the kiosk. The composition is organized and instructional, clearly conveying the hierarchy of the \"Assessment Trio\" and the progression of the steps.\n\n**Theme Integration (Professional Educator):** The Professor is portrayed with an air of expertise and authority. The entire scene is framed as a high-level medical seminar, using the whimsical characters as sophisticated mnemonic tools rather than a childish cartoon. Text on the kiosk and stickers is legible and uses professional medical fonts.",

The lighting is bright and scholarly, emphasizing clarity and instructional detail.\n\n**Image Description:**\nIn a vast, sun-drenched ivory lecture hall that opens into a boundless sky, **Professor Step-Up**—a distinguished academic with a neatly trimmed silver beard, wearing a formal navy tweed blazer with leather elbow patches and a graduation cap—stands authoritatively on a landing of a **Giant Stone Staircase**. The staircase is massive, with clearly defined levels labeled \"Step 1\" through \"Step 5\" carved into the risers, spiraling upward to represent the **Stepwise Approach**.\n\nThe Professor holds a long wooden pointer, gesturing toward a group of diverse students who are actively climbing the stairs. All students are dressed in **\"Ice-Cream-Suits\" (ICS)**: sleek, form-fitting protective gear that has a subtle ivory-white sheen and a faint waffle-cone texture, symbolizing their primary daily protection. \n\nHanging from each student's belt is a gleaming golden **\"S.O.S. Bell\" (Reliever)**. In the foreground, one student holds a **\"Salty-Butter-Owl\" (SABA)**—a small, feathered owl with yellow butter-like plumage—but the Professor is pointing approvingly toward another student accompanied by the **\"Ice-Cream-Soda-Former-Troll\" (ICS-Formoterol)**. This troll is a friendly, translucent blue creature made of bubbling soda and scoops of vanilla cream; it holds a frosty staff that is actively freezing a **Small Fire-Breathing Dragon (Exacerbation)** that is trying to puff smoke from the shadows of the steps.\n\nTo the side of the higher steps, a tall, majestic **\"Laba-the-Llama\" (LABA)** with a silk harness walks alongside a tired student, offering a steadying wooly back to lean on. Nearby, a tiny, armored ant-warrior, the **\"Luke-Tri-Ant-Goner\" (LTRA)**, stands guard with a microscopic shield.\n\n**Compositional Details:**\n*   **Perspective:** A wide-angle, slightly low-perspective shot looking up the staircase to emphasize the \"Step-Up\" progression.\n*   **Lighting:** Crisp, \"Golden Hour\" academic lighting streaming through tall library windows, creating a clean, professional atmosphere.\n*   **Color Palette:** Professional blues, teals, and creams contrasted with the vibrant red of the small dragons and the warm gold of the S.O.S. Bells.\n*   **Clarity:** Sharp focus on the Professor and the \"Ice-Cream-Soda-Former-Troll\" to highlight the preferred medical path.

            "story": "Welcome to the 'Bio-Laboratory of Bubbles' where our Professor, Dr. Chibi, is managing a wild group of lab assistants! First, 'Oh-Man-Liza' (Omalizumab) is trying to catch 'Iggy the Eagle' (IgE) with a giant sticky net because Iggy keeps dropping perennial flowers everywhere. Nearby, the 'Me-Pol-Res-Ben' trio (Mepolizumab, Reslizumab, Benralizumab) are spraying 'Fire Hose 5' (IL-5) at a mob of 'Rosy-Cheeked Eosins' (Eosinophils) who are trying to start a party. 'Do-Pool-Luma' (Dupilumab) is a scuba diver blocking the 'IL-4 Receptor Valve' to stop the IgE and Eosinophil pools from overflowing. Suddenly, 'Tez-the-Tease' (Tezepelumab) zaps the 'TSLP Lightning Bolt' to stop the whole lab from vibrating! Before anyone can work, Dr. Chibi checks their 'Pheno-ID Badges' (Phenotype assessment) which track their Eosinophil levels. Watch out—if the lab equipment breaks, it causes a 'Hammer-Head' (Headache) and a 'Red Injection Spot' on the floor!",
