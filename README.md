# MedMonics 🧠

**AI-Powered Medical Mnemonics Generator & Educational Platform**


> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disclaimer: This tool is NOT for medical advice.**
> MedMonics is designed to help medical professionals and students **retain information they have already learned** from primary sources. It is not a substitute for professional medical training, textbooks, or clinical guidelines. **We strongly encourage you to upload your own verified source materials** (textbooks, notes, guidelines) to generate accurate mnemonics tailored to your curriculum.

MedMonics uses Google's Gemini AI to revolutionize how medical students learn and retain complex information. By transforming dry medical facts into engaging, character-driven stories with custom illustrations and interactive quizzes, MedMonics leverages the power of active recall and dual coding theory to make studying efficient and memorable.

## 🎯 The Problem MedMonics Solves

Medical education requires the memorization of vast amounts of information—drug classes, disease criteria, physiological mechanisms, and anatomical structures. Traditional rote memorization is often tedious, fragile, and prone to forgetting.

**MedMonics bridges the gap between raw data and long-term retention by:**
*   **Converting Abstract to Concrete:** Turning complex concepts (e.g., "high output heart failure") into vivid visual analogies (e.g., a "motor-heart spinning out of control").
*   **Creating Narrative Hooks:** Weaving isolated facts into a cohesive story, making them easier to recall in sequence.
*   **Visual Reinforcement:** Generating custom illustrations where specific visual elements directly map to medical facts.
*   **Active Testing:** Immediately reinforcing the new mnemonic with AI-generated quizzes that link back to the story characters.

### 🔋 Boost Your Study Energy
Let's face it: medical school is exhausting. After a long day of rotations or lectures, your brain is often too fried for dry textbooks.
**MedMonics injects fun back into studying.** By turning study material into weird, funny, and colorful stories, we leverage emotion to make memories stick—even when your energy is low. Plus, unlike generic stock photos, our **customized** mnemonics are tailored specifically to the facts you need to know, making them far more memorable and personal.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 5-Step AI Generation Pipeline
Our sophisticated pipeline ensures high-quality, consistent educational content:
1.  **Mnemonic Engineering:** Analyzes medical facts to create a coherent story with sound-alike characters (e.g., "Sori the Robot" for "Psoriasis").
2.  **Visual Prompt Enhancement:** Refines the story into a detailed artistic description optimized for image generation.
3.  **AI Illustration:** Generates a custom image (Cartoon, Photorealistic, etc.) using Gemini's image generation capabilities.
4.  **Bbox Analysis:** Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash to visually locate and "box" the characters in the generated image for interactive highlighting.
5.  **Quiz Generation:** Creates multiple-choice questions that test the medical concept while referencing the story character.

### 2. Interactive Study Interface
*   **Dynamic Highlighting:** Click on a medical fact, and the corresponding character in the image lights up while the rest fades to grayscale.
*   **"Dive Deeper" Recursive Learning:** Click on any term to instantly generate a *new* nested mnemonic for that specific concept, creating a web of knowledge.
*   **Integrated Quizzes:** Test your recall immediately after learning the story.

### 3. Global Visual Challenge
A gamified review mode that continually tests your knowledge across all your saved mnemonics.
*   **Randomized Questions:** Draws from your entire library of generated content.
*   **Visual Hints:** Displays the image with only the relevant character highlighted to trigger visual memory.

### 4. Batch Processing Power
Perfect for creating study decks for entire subjects (e.g., "Pharmacology of Antibiotics").
*   **Topic Breakdown:** Input a broad topic (e.g., "Heart Failure"), and the AI breaks it down into subtopics.
*   **Bulk Generation:** Uses Gemini's Batch API to generate dozens of mnemonics and images in the background.
*   **Review & Edit:** Manage and refine your batch results in a dedicated dashboard.

## 📚 Example Output: Psoriasis Eritrodérmica

Here is an actual example of a mnemonic generated by MedMonics:

![Psoriasis Eritrodérmica Mnemonic](generations/20260127_223712_psoriasis_eritrodérmica/image.png)

### The Story: "Sori the Robot"
> "In the new movie using 'Sori the Red Robot', our protagonist Sori suffers a short circuit when his evil boss rips out his 'Corti-Cube' battery (Corticosteroid withdrawal). Instantly, 90% of Sori's circuits turn a glowing neon red (Erythroderma >90% body surface). Although he looks like he's burning up, Sori starts shivering with cold because he's lost his thermal insulation (Hypothermia). His heart-motor starts spinning at a crazy speed (High-output heart failure) trying to compensate for the disaster."

### Visual Associations
| Character | Medical Concept | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sori the Red Robot** | *Psoriasis Eritrodérmica* | The main character represents the disease, highlighting the varying red skin color. |
| **90% Circuits Glowing** | *>90% Body Surface Area* | Defines the clinical criteria for erythroderma. |
| **Removed "Corti-Cube"** | *Corticosteroid Withdrawal* | A common trigger for this severe form of psoriasis. |
| **Shivering Robot** | *Hypothermia* | Loss of skin barrier leads to inability to regulate temperature. |
| **Spinning Heart-Motor** | *High-Output Heart Failure* | Massive vasodilation requires the heart to work harder. |

### Quiz Question
**Q:** In the analogy of Sori, the "90% circuits glowing" defines a fundamental diagnostic criterion. What does this value refer to in clinical practice?
*   **A) The threshold of total body surface area affected to define erythroderma** ✅
*   B) The percentage of mortality risk without treatment
*   C) The probability of recurrence
*   *Explanation: Erythrodermic psoriasis is technically defined when erythema and scaling affect more than 90% of the patient's total body surface area.*
